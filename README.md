## File Structure

The project follows a standard Flutter application structure:

├── android <br>
├── assets <br>
├── build <br>
├── lib <br>
│ ├── pages <br>
│ └── main.dart <br>
├── test <br>
│ └── widget_test.dart <br>
├── .gitignore <br>
├── pubspec.yaml <br>
└── README.md <br>


-   `android/`: Contains Android-specific project files. 
-   `assets/`: This directory holds static assets like images, fonts, etc.
-   `build/`: This is an auto-generated directory that contains the compiled output of the project.
-   `lib/`: The core of the Flutter application, where all the Dart code resides.
    -   `pages/`: This likely contains the different screens or pages of the application.
    -   `main.dart`: The entry point of the application. 
-   `test/`: Contains all the test files for the application. 
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
-   `pubspec.yaml`: Manages the project's dependencies and other metadata. 
-   `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing information about the project.
